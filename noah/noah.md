Noah DeVico inspired the hearts and minds of many young innovators. He was
part of an FLL team for 2 seasons, and went on to become a founding member of
Brain Stormz where he competed, mentored and served in FTC for 5 seasons. He
also mentored 4 seasons of FLL students. Tragically, Noah’s life was taken in an
accident, however his legacy lives on in the students he has inspired, and we can
all learn from the example he gave us all. “And so we know and rely on the love
God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God and God in them.”
