# Brain Stormz


The _Brain Stormz_ organization exists to prepare students for careers in product design & delivery organizations.

Our means for accomplishing this is to build & nurture a team that wins the FTC world championship every year, within the following constraints:

  - maximum 40% outside contributions (parents, advisors, coaches, etc)
  - < 12 hrs/week average time committment
