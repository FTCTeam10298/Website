                <p>Today, Noah and Jacob gave a second challenge to the students, with an element of FTC. One team was offense, and the second defense. The goal for the offense team was to score balls through a center objective, while the defense team had to stop them without touching their robot. In the end, the winning team was able to outscore by having a very effective defense, denying the other team points.</p>

Our school allowed us to demonstrate our robot, as well as give a small speech about FIRST, FTC, and our team. We also were allowed to set up a booth, where we can talk further with interested people. We originally intended to have our robot drive around on the stage, but unfortunately, we encountered technical difficulties and were unable to do so. We explained more about FIRST and talked about our season to a crowd of around 400 people. We also played a 3-minute video we had made that showed highlights of our season, from our early meetings and league meets to elimination rounds in Houston. It was overall a great night, and we had people come up to us afterwards and ask for more information.</p>

I cooked hotdogs for everyone and the families brought other food. I then lead a meeting explaining to the families what the season would entail. Then I showed the kids our bot from FTC and how it works.</p>

He also got some programming advice for one of last year's problems (driving straight with a gyro autocorrect not overcorrecting). He got to see some of their projects, and even got to see how one of the engineers hacked into a computer! Overall he had a great time, and learned a lot, both for the team, but also for his own knowledge.</p>

They offered to give us a free, one on one meeting with one of their teachers to teach us the basics of Solidworks. We went over there and learned about creating parts and assemblies. Afterwards he showed us some of their other 3D printing creations, and told us about their various projects. It overall was an excellent experience, and we are sure to use CAD in designing our robot this season! </p>

However this meeting was mainly about the robot. With the Thunder Chickens' EV3 robot we showed them how to run an accuracy test. This led them to discover the inaccuracy of their bot. We also had the kids begin programming their first mission. For the rest of meeting the kids worked on updating their bot's motors.</p>

The speaker worked for <a href="http://www.flir.com/">FLIR</a>, a thermal imaging company. After the talk, they experimented with two of FLIR's infrared cameras. One was attached to the bottom of a phone and the other was a hand held camera, which took photos. In total, there were about 100 girls in all the classes. They offered free classes and served lunch. Overall, it was a fun way to learn about infrared. </p>

However, after they had made some progress on the robot, the computer shut off, and they hadn't saved, so all the code was lost. Time to start from scratch.</p>

                <p>Today was the first tournament of the season for our FLL team, the Thunder Chickens. At the practice tournament, we started by testing our robot and fine tuning for the matches. We had our first practice match, and we scored -10 points. The team was really bummed, but they kept going and got better with every run, until they reached a high score of 40 points. They also had their judge's presentation, and did an excellent job, earning high marks in all categories. Although they didn't win any awards, they still felt like winners, and everyone had a great time.</p>

                <p>The Thunder Chickens had their first meeting back after the tournament today, and we discussed what had happened and how we may improve for the Qualifying tournament in two weeks. On the judging side, everything went well, and the team got high marks all around. On the robot side, the team felt they needed to vastly improve their performance. We changed the batteries and began testing. After a full meeting, we had started several other missions other than the ones we had been doing and were feeling set for next week.</p>

                <p>Today was the final meeting for the Thunder Chickens before the qualifying tournament because we canceled this week's open lab because our own first tournament was quickly approaching. The kids built another attachment and hard core programmed, knowing that this was their final class before it all counted. By the end of the day, they were pumped, and were prepared for tournament on Saturday.</p>

                <p>Today was the 6th class for the Group Solutions class, and we tried something new: we had the kids start a challenge that would continue into the next class. Taking some of the mission models from the FLL table, we made a small 'course' with tape that, with some minor building and following of lines, could be used to test the kid's skills. The kids seemed to like the challenge, and began to build and program their robots. As mentioned, this activity took too long, so we will continue in two weeks.</p>

                <p>It was finally here: the FLL team we have been mentoring for the last several months finally had their qualifying tournament! We got there bright and early, and they finalized their programs, and then started their rounds! Every round they competed in up to the final round, they increased their points. They also had their judging, which went very well, and we learned afterward that they got near perfect marks. In order to qualify for the Los Angeles Regional Championships, they would have to score a 95, a score that was above their max score. The kids stepped up though, and programed and built to score high enough. However, when they ran the robot, they were not able to score the necessary 95 points, and as such, did not qualify. However, it still felt like a win, especially after they won the Robot Design Award, 2nd place. This was especially a victory for us, because when we had done FLL many years ago, we had won every award at some point, except a Robot Design Award. We were very proud of the kids, and we learned just as much from teaching them as they did from being taught. We were grateful for the opportunity to teach, and we are now looking forward to next season.</p>

                <p>Today was the first class for the FLL team we have been mentoring, the Thunder Chickens, since their qualifying tournament. Although the team did not advance to the Los Angeles Championship, we still felt that they deserve an award for their hard work, so we hosted an award ceremony for them, presenting them with individual awards. We also tried to film a perfect run with their robot, but unfortunately it wasn't working. They were a hardworking and dedicated team, and we are considering some of them for recruitment next season for our team. Who knows - these kids may end up being our team in a few years!</p>

                <p>Today's FLL class was the last class of the semester. Next semester, we start Beginning Robotics (the same class we teach at the Group Solutions Co-op) as well as Advanced Robotics (a completely new class) at Trinity. Today, we had the kids, who would go into Advanced Robotics next semester, learn some programming concepts, because not all the kids were on the same page with regards to programming for Advanced Robotics. We had them do the same challenge Beginning Robotics was doing, and they did great. We then let them do Robot Sumo, a fun activity that we do in Engineering Club, and they had a blast. We loved working with these kids this past semester, and we are looking forward to the next!</p>
