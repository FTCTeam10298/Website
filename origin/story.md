# Our Beginnings

Brain Stormz originally began as a seven-member FIRST Lego League (FLL) team: Team #2160, The B.E.S.T. Team (Building Excellent Structures Together).  This team competed in multiple seasons and game challenges, up through the 2014-15 season, scoring well and growing as a team.

In mid-2015, as we planned for our next season (2015-16), we were faced with a challenge: two of our core members were moving into high school, and more than half of our team members were done with FIRST programs.  We had a difficult decision to make: Stay in FLL one more year now that we had more experience, or move on to the next level with less than half of our original team.  As a team, we resolved to move on and face the next level, FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). It wasn't a complete jump in the dark, as one of our team members from B.E.S.T, Nathan Choi, had been on a different FTC team before, and a friend from an engineering club joined our team for the FTC year.  Our first meetings as a team were before we even knew what the challenge was. We planned, prepared, discussed, fundraised, and had a pool party!  We were ready to face the road ahead, despite whatever challenges may come, as FTC Team #10298: Brain Stormz.
