# Our Robot - 2017-18 Relic Recovery Season:

This season, our approach to designing our robot has changed. Last season, we noticed that many interesting, potentially high scoring designs that we prototyped never made it on the robot, such as a cap ball lifter and an improved, spring loaded shooter. We found the reason was because we were too focused on getting the robot working now rather than thinking towards what are robot should look like in the future. Because of this, our engineering process this season started out with prototyping every possible mechanism so we didn't need to leave any point scoring elements off our robot later in the season.  Our strategy was to be as offensive as possible, as defense didn't look like a viable option, given the extremely reduced and sectioned space in this year's challenge. Compatibility, which was a large part of last year's game, was a low priority as well, as no missions in autonomous or TeleOp required both alliance partners to work well with each other to succeed. This in mind, we set out to make a robot that could be effective while alone, and help an alliance partner, too.

With our strategy decided upon, we shifted towards prototyping three key scoring elements: a glyph delivery system, a glyph collector, and a stable drive train.

Our initial drive train was a 6-wheel tank drive utilizing Rev's extrusion mounting system, which gave us a lightweight and customizable base for our robot.

After brainstoming couple ideas for a delivery mechanism, we decided on a conveyor system that could extend to deliver glyphs from a distance, giving us a significant time advantage when compared to a claw delivery system.

# Our Story - 2017-18 Relic Recovery Season:

When September finally came around, the team was super excited. They were about to embark on another year of FTC and have another set of challenges to overcome. What could be better? After waiting in expectation all summer, Relic Recovery's reveal was a huge treat and the team immediately started brainstorming ways to approach it. Someone suggested we use something like a conveyor belt to move the glyphs from one side of the robot to the other, an idea that met with much approval. Further expanding this idea, we thought that it might be more efficient if we could just extend this conveyor belt from our robot to the cryptobox in order to place the glyphs directly where they need to go. We quickly found that we could easily use the drawer slides from last year's cap ball mechanism to work as an extending conveyor belt by simply stringing taut surgical tubing parallel to the slides between two axles controlled by a motor. However, this was still in the prototype phase when League Meet 0 approached, so we constructed a simple robot with a jewel arm and two glyph grabbers, one that only moves vertically, and another, also known as the "slam dunk claw", that pivoted in the middle, allowing it to reach both sides of our robot. With the addition of an autonomous program and driving practice, we did quite well at this first meet, in spite of our simplistic design and a few problems.

Meet 1 soon followed, as did much improvement. We rebuilt our slam dunk claw so that it could hold two glyphs and spin them, in order to grab and deposit glyphs most efficiently. In addition, we realized that this claw worked much better at transporting glyphs over our robot than the clumsy prototype of a conveyor belt we had been working on, so we decided to continue using that and drop the conveyor idea. However, our prototyping was not over there; the relic arm remained. Thus, we redirected our focus to the creation of that mechanism, while still improving the claw arm. We have tried to make similar linear slide systems for three years now, so this year we were able to build off of our previous experiences to begin this mechanism.

While this was going on, we were simultaneously developing our next chassis in CAD. We took this design to some professionals who graciously reviewed them and made some suggestions, which we gratefully accepted. This new chassis uses Mecanum wheels, allowing us to move in any direction without turning. It will also have room for Jewel arms cut in the sides, as well as removable top plates with the standard hole pattern cut in for easy access to the chained drive motors.

Having all of these mechanisms still in development, we brought our new and improved claw to Meet 2, not sure of what to expect. Although our auto was a little rough, we ended up filling the first full Cryptobox in the region, exceeding everyone's (mostly ours) expectations! Our Christmas break was spent thinking of how amazing it was to fill that Crypto, and how we hope to do it again in Meet 3.

The main change on our robot from Meets 2-3 was the thinning of the claws on the arm to allow us to more easily place glyphs in the box. However, we were far from unproductive during this time; we finished both our Relic mechanism and our chassis. Neither of them were competition ready, so they didn't end up on the robot. Instead, we used what we knew and went back, actually scoring the regional high score at the time, and ending up at the end of the league meets ranked 1st.

After Meet 3, it was all hands on deck, full steam ahead on FutureBot, as this was the biggest gap of time between competitions that we would have for the rest of the season. The slam dunk arm was taken off of our old chassis and mounted onto the new, alongside our Relic mechanism. We also began working on a glyph intake mechanism that would facilitate the collection of glyphs into our claws using compliant wheels. We tested this mechanism at a scrimmage we hosted with several local teams, and found that it was shredding our glyphs, literally tearing them to pieces. We then made them flip down on plexiglass rods so that they would not tear the glyphs, and it was a huge improvement. Whereas before we were struggling to fill a Crypto without a pattern, we were now comfortably filling Cryptos with pattern consistently. We were prepared for ILTs, and ready to take the new competition by Stormz!

Kimberly Sharp truly enjoys being on team Brain Stormz. She has been a part of FLL team B.E.S.T. team for two years before this and really loved it. However, in her 10th grade year she feared she had too large of a school load to take on the extra challenge of FTC, deciding not to be on the team. Last year, she came back, not because of a lighter school load, but because she missed it so much she is willing to risk overload in order to be on such a great team as Brain Stormz. She knows from experience that it is well worth it.
