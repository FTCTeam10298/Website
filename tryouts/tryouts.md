# How do I Become A Team Member?

Membership with Brain Stormz is not automatic.  Membership is normally a 3-step process: (tryouts must be completed by August 6)

If you're interested in joining Brain Stormz contact us via [Holler](https://holler.fyi/s/5bd0f5brainstormz) or email (<ftc10298@gmail.com>) and let us know that you want to try out.

You will have the option to choose between two types of tryout tests:
