# How do I Become A Team Member?

Membership with Brain Stormz is not automatic.  Membership is normally a 3-step process:

## Step 1: Contact us.

If you're interested in joining Brain Stormz contact us via [Holler](https://holler.fyi/s/5bd0f5brainstormz) or email (<ftc10298@gmail.com>) and let us know that you want to try out.

For those looking to become a core engineering team member, you will have the option to choose between two types of tryout challenges:
- Coding
- Building

*(Note: The challenge you choose won't lock you into a particular type of role on the team, as it is mainly to gauge ability and willingness to learn.)*

## Step 2: Online Challenge

Applicants will be given an introductory challenge to get them accustomed to the tools we use on Brain Stormz.

## Step 3: In-person Challenge

Applicants will come to the lab and participate in a challenge which goes through the process of robot making from ideation and planning to execution and competition.

## Step 4: Team Decides

After completing the challenges, members will be selected on the basis of:

- Enthusiasm & Interest
- Focus
- Teachability
- Natural Ability
- Ability to meet time commitments
    - ~5-20 hours/week, depending on role
    - 2+ weekly meetings in Thousand Oaks
    - 5+ competitions
- Ability to fill one or more needed roles
