# Offseason Try-outs

Brain Stormz is excited to announce the start of Try-Outs for the upcoming 2022/23 FTC season. Come join us to see if you have what it takes (enthusiasm & dedication) to be a part of this award-winning, world-competitive robotics team.

## Why Join Brain Stormz?

Brain Stormz exists to build excellence & capability in the areas of leadership, product design, software/hardware engineering, manufacturing & promotion. If you are a high-school student aged 13-18 & are interested in building real-world skills in the context of a competitive robotics team, this is the right opportunity for you.

## What is Brain Stormz?

Brain Stormz is an accomplished, championship, private, non-profit robotics team competing in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).  The team is based in Ventura County, with most meetings in Thousand Oaks (near The Oaks mall), except for field trips and the occasional party.  We are a homeschooled, community team, with informal ties to local groups such as Trinity Pacific Christian School, Group Solutions, and Classical Conversations.

## What's FTC?

It's way more than building robots.  FIRST Tech Challenge teams are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.

Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.

Parts and assemblies are reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of JVM-based programming.  Teams design and build robots, raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to earn specific awards. Participants are eligible to apply for $80M+ in college scholarships.

Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting world championship.
