### Gabriel Fergesen 

Team role: Coder
Years in FIRST: This is my FIRST year (uwu)
Age: 14
Favorite food: everything, but I hate tomatoes and condiments, and LOVE asian/big juicy steaks/Indian food.

Gabriel didn't think he'd ever end up on a FIRST team, but here he is, and he'll make the best of it (although he's a little nervous). He has repeatedly dabbled in code, Neural Networks, and Python ever since his science fair project in 7th Grade. He just wants to know enough code to make odd things involving art, 3D printing, and social game design, but has ended up writing a novel, *Tales of Atlantis Six Vol. 1*, building robots, and a variety of other activities. Woe be to the person who questions Gabriel Fergesen about Portal, books, or Ingress Prime, as he loves to talk about his fandoms. (yes, he is indeed a nerd.)

While this is her first official year in FIRST, she has been involved through her brother (Luke Schrodi) for much longer than that. Her pre-official contributions include exciting things like desinging the team-logo for the Thunder Chickens or being a ref at an FLL regional competition. She also did the small things like bringing donuts to scrimmages, helping team member's with their project scripts, or making sure that every moment was captured with pictures and videos. Madeleine is thrilled to finally be an official team member and is excited to see what this year will hold.

Peter had been in FLL for two seasons as a part of (then) rookie team, Thunder Chickens and is starting his first year in FTC. In his own words, he "was amazing at every thing in FLL and will be in FTC". While he said that completely jokingly (as it was farrrr from the truth), it speaks to his motivation and drive to excel in this new competition. Other than robotics, he enjoys flying 5th scale, which is super huge, RC planes.
