### What is FIRST? 
FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a non-profit organization that seeks to inspire the younger generation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). It accomplishes this by engaging kids in exciting, mentor-based research and robotics programs that will help them become science and technology leaders for the future. Not only does FIRST encourage participants in STEM, but it also places great emphasis on great core values such as gracious professionalism and cooperation, which foster well-rounded life and work skills.

### What is FTC?
FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) teams are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge. Teams must also raise funds, design, and market their team brand, and do community outreach in order to earn specific awards. Participants are encouraged to bring any skills they already have, like coding, electronics, graphic design, web creation, public speaking, etc. Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting FIRST Championship.

### Who are we?
'Brain Stormz' is a private, non-profit robotics team competing in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). As a team, we strive to uphold FIRST’s core values. One of the values that we place the most focus on is “Gracious Professionalism”. With Gracious Professionalism, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. We allow our competition to drive us to do our best, but never so far as to degrade others. Another core value that we embrace is cooperation. When we talk about cooperation, we are not only referring to cooperation between team members and mentors, but it must include other FTC teams and our community. In past years, the emphasis we have placed on these values has earned us many awards and, most importantly, it has taught us how to become well-rounded, gracious professionals who are excited about our futures.
