                        <h2>2017-2018 season</h2>
                <p>This season, our approach to designing our robot has changed. Last season, we noticed that many interesting, potentially high scoring designs that we prototyped never made it on the robot, such as a cap ball lifter and an improved, spring loaded shooter. We found the reason was because we were too focused on getting the robot working now rather than thinking towards what are robot should look like in the future. Because of this, our engineering process this season started out with prototyping every possible mechanism so we didn’t need to leave any point scoring elements off our robot later in the season.&nbsp; Our strategy was to be as offensive as possible, as defense didn’t look like a viable option, given the extremely reduced and sectioned space in this year’s challenge. Compatibility, which was a large part of last year’s game, was a low priority as well, as no missions in autonomous or TeleOp required both alliance partners to work well with each other to succeed. This in mind, we set out to make a robot that could be effective while alone, and help an alliance partner, too.</p>
                <p>With our strategy decided upon, we shifted towards prototyping&nbsp;three key scoring elements: a glyph delivery system, a glyph collector, and a stable drive train.</p>

                <h2>2016-2017 season</h2>
                <p>Our robot has gone through many different software changes, designs, and redesigns, but through all of it our main strategy has stayed the same. At the beginning of our season we brainstormed what our strategy should be. We considered all of our flaws in last year’s strategies and also the few scoring elements in this year’s game, and its heavy focus on autonomous. Our strategy for TeleOp is to be good at all three components of this year’s game. Considering there are only three ways to score we decided that it would be possible to design a robot that would be able to do everything well. We started with shooting, and once we finished making our shooting mechanism we added a beacon pusher. While adding all these we have kept in mind the fact that later in the season we will be adding a cap ball mechanism. Doing some of everything allows us to be compatible with all other teams, allowing both us and our alliance partner to perform as well as they can. However, at the beginning of the season we knew we would need something to carry us through to the regional tournament, our autonomous. For this year we bought a whole bunch of new sensors including a color sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and a light sensor. We used these to create a consistent, high scoring autonomous. In the first thirty seconds of a match we are able to shoot two “particles” (whiffle balls), hit two beacons to the correct color, and park on either the center or corner vortex, depending on what our partner does. Our autonomous program can consistently score 100 points without breaking a sweat.</p>
                <p>Once we had a good strategy, it was time to build. Our robot mechanisms have gone through many complete redesigns including our shooting mechanism, collection mechanism and even our chassis.</p>

                <h4>Our Epic Robot- Metal Gear</h4>
                <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6-fQMRIpD1-OnkoRcJImEezsbkjRxDvf1YYpqtzhQug1LxqSv2L8HoPYcknDv19r7cWMSo6OSHf68YcEaSKwWGl48Tenly9Y6dn1VAmq46d3KLjvKjnPxaMjRHOhR0jL8TMcUh1C" alt="" scale="0"></p>
                <h5>11/21/2015- Modified PushBot</h5>
                <p>Our first design was a variation of PushBot, a basic robot built from instructions on the FIRST website. Key points are the wood base, the monstrous useless arm, and loose wheels that couldn’t do much. We made no progress up the mountain with this one, for obvious reasons.</p>
                <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R-sLQ02SZYKOQ0KKbCXzfwFPV76KwXS3OjQMJYYmMHcQZKOTMZYgKfcvBVEumGVS-gKmue6vFYRpmFmU3O6RhKb7-7hcaYAG9MoLGWpVHG87O_Ixkuv9_ydqpUn8dwEwxPVog8Pi" alt="" scale="0"></p>
                <h5>12/3/2015- Six-Wheeled Monstrosity</h5>
                <p>We had expected treads by this time, but they were back-ordered. This was our pitiful attempt at fixing that- two extra wheels. It was still too top heavy to make it onto the ramp. At least we held the electronics better with this one.</p>
                <p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SVQnqTVfHLaFuqyONfvJyIDBMQ9Aj2PHJw2Fo69b-fzvV633_GraTybs66vCHPw7hjRH1QDcgeh2zRRRAGetvgHLjMnTnd_WsIjro4x5Lb_IK_FY1p3ZpjDGgQxnjU0CkXEQ9mzS" alt="" scale="0"></p>
                <h5>12/13/2015- MiniBot</h5>
                <p>We visited another team and got some better ideas about our design. After doing some planning, we took apart our old robot and created a new base- all metal, sturdy, and ready to add more attachments. The robot made it higher up the mountain than ever before, which was another indication that we needed balanced weight to succeed.</p>
                <p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5w5_403zms1e9d8E0vXbripKeYe_alspEdvSzNb5EvzGKedazm3AhvPwWV50XHUU86NUjA2phlCBEtq8r1RpIeim-0MwmYAKskZ1GA6jid6lUlfSjR1-uj0fKH7EHDNYBdcpG1JU" alt="" scale="0"></p>
                <h5>12/16/2015- The Heavy-Weight</h5>
                <p>We had our base; the next step was to add an arm that ran on rack-and-pinion. And so we did. But the design wasn’t quite right yet… it was too heavy to make it up the mountain, and we weren’t sure the arm would work even if we did. Another problem is that the wires got tangled up.</p>
                <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/O04GA9BYrRGZIdeYKD2AcQ1GBrs41-NSV2984sCRnK29Rc3tBo3M4N_Kp534QpFNTUU5QSFrLlTD3REo0Gq5oXTII6i61SQW2sHaB_hkA_MaeSFA6BkQlx-nXXccDuUyNakeGWDL" alt="" scale="0"></p>
                <h5>12/19/2015- Tread Boss</h5>
                <p>We finally got our treads! We could make it part of the way up the mountain, but it always kept flipping over. We needed a better arm design… something that was strong enough to lift the robot, yet light and compact enough that it wouldn’t hinder our mountain climbing. (Also notice the zip-ties keeping our wires together)</p>
                <p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/AAPDPOmjOKf8zJ1tjfGKLdVwwRUbnf5q9nOjs7cHq5hrjn9suwlOCPz9e7fXV8ePNPHegWzhGJh5S3G5sl0kCIhJx-cTYeqWMxruOmB27ayhx3S-oRiLlVWbUJkCxFlJ6--v-EWm" alt="" scale="0"></p>
                <h5>1/15/2016- Tread Boss v2.0 (Now climbs mountains!) A.K.A. The Tumbler</h5>
                <p dir="ltr">We used a completely different method to climb up the mountain- a tape measure. It’s strong, durable, light and slim, and (most importantly) it works! It’s amazing! It also has two attachments for flipping switches, a bumper for pushing obstacles, two wheels in the back to help it get over the bars, and various stability improvements.</p>
                <h5>2/xx/2016- The Unicorn ResQer</h5>
                <p>We ran into a problem at our second tournament- our switch-flipping attachments were not strong enough to activate the levers. We fixed it by putting the servos at a different angle and putting a shield around the bars. Another addition was a one-way hinge in the back that would protect electrical components from debris (in one round the debris detached a wire and shut down the entire robot) but bends out of the way when our robot goes up the bars. Also note that we used plastic for our tape measure holder rather than wood (which kept breaking apart); we included a ‘unicorn horn’ to hold the climbers and drop them into the basket; we added omni-wheels to allow the robot to turn better, and we added a mechanism to activate the all clear signal at the top of the mountain.</p>
                <h5>?/??/2016- FutureBot</h5>
                <p>And what’s next for Metal Gear? We still could make a device to collect debris or work on sensors for a better autonomous. We could also use an arm to press the button on the rescue beacon. The possibilities are endless!</p>
