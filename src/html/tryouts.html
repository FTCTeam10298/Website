                <h2>What is Brain Stormz?</h2>
                <p>Brain Stormz is an accomplished, championship, private, non-profit robotics team&nbsp;competing in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).&nbsp; The team is based in Ventura County, with most meetings in Thousand Oaks (near The Oaks mall), except for field trips and the occasional party.&nbsp; We are a homeschooled, community team, with informal ties to local groups such as Trinity Pacific Christian School, Group Solutions, and Classical Conversations.</p>
                <h2>What's FTC?</h2>
                <p>It's way more than building robots. &nbsp;FIRST Tech Challenge teams are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.</p>
                <p>Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.</p>
                <p>Parts and assemblies are reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of JVM-based programming. &nbsp;Teams design and build robots, raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach to earn specific awards. Participants are eligible to apply for $80M+ in college scholarships.</p>
                <p>Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting world championship.</p>
