                <p>Kimberly Sharp truly enjoys being on team Brain Stormz. She has been a part of FLL team B.E.S.T. team for two years before this and really loved it. However, in her 10th grade year she feared she had too large of a school load to take on the extra challenge of FTC, deciding not to be on the team. Last year, she came back, not because of a lighter school load, but because she missed it so much she is willing to risk overload in order to be on such a great team as Brain Stormz. She knows from experience that it is well worth it.</p>
